Materials and tools for the garden module:

What we used:

    Materials:
    - 3 2x4 lumbers
    - 1 2x3 plywood
    - Wood Screws
    - 3 pipes 38 inch long water pipes
    - 6 pieces of appropriately sized pipe hangers
    - 3 pieces of thinner pipes for drainage

All the measurements and the parts used are dependent on the size and dimensions of the solar panel being used and are totally customizable.

1) We designed and built the base of the stand to achieve balance upon mounting and filling the pipes with water. We built the base with two pieces of 34 inch, two pieces of 20 inch lumbers and a 20x26 inch piece of plywood. We then built the frame and screwed in the plywood on top of the frame, parallel to the ground.

2) For the stand and the columns that would then be used to mount the tubes, we used two 48 inches long lumbers. The lumbers were screwed vertically on to the base and was stabilized with diagonally cut triangle pieces of plywood which was also screwed on the base.

3) Setting up the pipes:
    i) We cut out a row of holes for housing the plastic pots on each pipe.
    ii) We then cut out smaller holes, one hole per pipe, on the opposite side of each pipe , which is then used in connecting the pipes with each other and allow drainage.
    iii) We cut out another small hole on the pipes aligned with the holes allocated for the pots. This hole was cut out on the opposite side of the pipe compared to the hole cut out in step 3.ii. So when pipes are placed horizontally on a vertical plane, the water can cycle through the entire system starting from the top pipe going out of the bottom pipe in to a bucket.

4) We then mounted the pipes on the system using pipe hangers, which we screwed horizontally making sure that they were level with the ground, with 5.5 inch distance between each pipe.
