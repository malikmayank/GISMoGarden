Materials and tools for the frame of the solar panel:

What we used:

    Materials:
    - 8 2x4 lumbers
    - 2 2x3 plywood
    - Wood Screws

All the measurements and the parts used are dependent on the size and dimensions of the solar panel being used and are totally customizable.

1) We started by building the base of the stand for the solar panel. The base required two 2x4 lumbers and one 2x3 plywood. In order to achieve sturdiness, we created a 40 by 26 inch frame for the plywood. Upon screwing the frame together we placed the 43.5 by 23 inch plywood on top of the frame and screwed it in to the frame. The plywood on the base is used to house the battery.

2) Once the base is complete, next we moved on to the legs. Since we wanted the solar panel to be at approximately 35 degrees angle from the ground, the back legs of the stand are 28 inches longer than the front legs. We used two 2x4 lumbers to build the legs. each lumber was cut in to two pieces, front and back leg. We then screwed the legs to the outer part of the base and moved on to the middle shelf.

3) The shelf was built identical to the base. We again used one 2x3 plywood and two 2x4 lumbers. The shelf was built to house the equipment needed to get the solar panel to work.

4) Lastly, we built the bed for the solar panel. The bed of the solar panel did not require a plywood and only 2 2x4 lumbers. We cut the lumbers in to two 50 inch and two 26 inch long pieces. The design of the bed made sure the bottom part of the bed had a stop which bridged the two side by side 50 inch lumbers. The frame of the bed was designed only to stop the solar panel from sliding vertically. Since the dimensions of the solar panel we used is 20 by 46.5 inches, we screwed the two side by side lumbers 15 inches apart from each other on to the legs. In order to prevent the solar panel from moving sideways, we then screwed two smaller pieces of about 4 inches long to the side of the frame towards the top of the stand.
